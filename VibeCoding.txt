# Vibe Coding

What is vibe coding? 

Vibe coding is using AI coding agents to generate software with minimal manual coding. 

Vibe Coding is different than normal coding in that it: 

- Users write as little manual code as possible. 
- Users relay information about bugs and errors to the AI and let the AI solve them instead of manually debugging.
- The apps are typically less securem harder to read, and harder to maintain.

Pros of vibe coding: 

- Good for rapid prototyping or MVP development
- Good for personal tools (static websites)
- Good for single use apps (Send an email every morning)

Cons of vibe coding: 

- Often produces insecure code by using outdated packages
- "The tipping point problem" - code works for awhile then the architecture fails
- Not great for long term maintenance programs

Platforms: 

- Replit, Loveable, OpenAI's Canvas, Claude Artifacts, Cursor, and windsurf.
